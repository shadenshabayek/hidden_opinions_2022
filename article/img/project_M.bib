@article{lorenz,
	Abstract = {Models of opinion formation are used to investigate many collective phenomena. While social influence often constitutes a basic mechanism, its implementation differs between the models. In this article, we provide a general framework of social influence based on dissonance mini- mization. We only premise that individuals strive to minimize dissonance resulting from dif- ferent opinions compared to individuals in a given social network. Within a game theoretic context, we show that our concept of dissonance minimization resembles a coordination pro- cess when interactions are homogeneous. We further show that different models of opinion formation can be represented as best response dynamics within our framework. Thus, we offer a unifying perspective on these heterogeneous models and link them to rational choice theory.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT
We explore a new mechanism to explain polarization phenomena in opinion dynamics in which agents evaluate alternative views on the basis of
the social feedback obtained on expressing them. High support of the favored opinion in the social environment is treated as a positive feedback
which reinforces the value associated to this opinion. In connected networks of sufficiently high modularity, different groups of agents can form
strong convictions of competing opinions. Linking the social feedback process to standard equilibrium concepts we analytically characterize sufficient conditions for the stability of bi-polarization. While previous models have emphasized the polarization effects of deliberative argument-based communication, our model highlights an affective experience-based route to polarization, without assumptions about negative influence or bounded confidence.},
